Step 1: Configuring pam_faillock
The first step is to configure pam_faillock. The configuration file is located at /etc/security/faillock.conf. Open the file in your preferred text editor. Here, we use nano:

sudo nano /etc/security/faillock.conf

In this file, you can set several options. Here’s an example configuration:

dir = /var/run/faillock
audit
silent
deny = 3
fail_interval = 900
unlock_time = 120

Here’s what each option does:

dir: This is the directory where pam_faillock will store the tally files.
audit: This option enables audit logging.
silent: This option makes pam_faillock not report the user’s remaining attempts.
deny: This is the number of failed attempts that triggers pam_faillock to lock the account.
fail_interval: This is the time period (in seconds) during which the failed attempts are counted.
unlock_time: This is the time period (in seconds) for which the account is locked.
